Standardization Prompt:

Purpose: Sharpen design for scalability, performance, and maintainability. 

Template: 
Context: Review the module roadmap layout. Currently we have tiers 0-5 and stages A-D. Each tier and stage contains different modules. Roadmap design is fragmented. Standardize. 

Critique the current design for scalability, performance, and maintainability. Identify weaknesses and suggest revisions. Explain why each change matters. 

Output: a refined, production-quality module roadmap plan.
