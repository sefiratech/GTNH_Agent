(Upload the old module workflow with this prompt):

I am now attaching a file that contains the old [] module workflow. It should be treated only as a template for how the module workflow should be structured. It should not be treated as particularly relevant in content, because it is outdated. However, my project notes rely on the standardization of this template structure.

Please superimpose the contents of the context primer onto the template structure of the old [] module workflow. The output should be a finished, up-to-date [] module workflow that exactly matches the structure of the old module. Its contents should not reflect those of the old [] workflow unless absolutely necessary.

Please acknowledge and reflect what I'm asking you to do before executing.
