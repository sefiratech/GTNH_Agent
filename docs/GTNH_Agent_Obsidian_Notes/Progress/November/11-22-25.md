Finished the notes on the skeleton of the build - file structure, rough code drafting, prompts used, and their outputs. The roadmap is finished. Now it's about dialing in the details.

Working out exactly what each file's code should contain, going in order of the roadmap.

Completed M0 and created context primer to be ready to dive into M1.
