Finished M2

Wired up support for GPU offloading. Getting ~52 tok/s. Acceptable.

Finished M3. I added a whole section that ended up being bigger than the original module because the semantics of GTNH is astronomical. So I dumped the block, item, and recipe info directly from the modpack using NEI's block and item dumps, which produced .csv files that I then converted to .json. I used NotEnoughRecipeDumps by Hermanoid to dump the chonkiest .json files the world has ever seen. Then I built ingestion scripts into the file stucture of the agent to standardize the .json files I obtained from the dump/conversion process. The generated .json files for items and blocks were of acceptable size but the file for recipes was still ~400mb. So I created another script to compress it, which output a ~215mb file called gtnh_recipes.agent.json. That will be good enough for now because this file only loads on startup, not every loop. And later, I will shard the semantics for better efficiency, but I can't do that until more of the agent is built.
